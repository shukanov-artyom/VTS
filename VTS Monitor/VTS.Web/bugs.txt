!!! end of vehicle registration on delivered key is incorrect!
!!! i can upload data on another partner's vehicle without any warning!

- client sees Partner 60-days license message after registration

- license issuance dialog in Admin console final stage - layout
- LicenseRequestApprovalWindow (for manual licenses approval) sucks

- license activation with key creation step 1 window layout - data grid

- i can ingest vehicle data when the vehicle is registere to another partner. It shows it as registered like it's mine but it's not mine

- cannot refresh the "saved data" page if there is only 1 vehicle

- cannot issue licenses from admin console by Cash requests, exception

- Clients button in Admin console does not work
